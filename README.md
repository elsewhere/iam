This is the full source code to the Traction demo I Am released at Assembly 2004. 

Originally the code was compiled with MSVC6, so if you would want to build it today, some work would be required. The main demo system in /demotractor was written by Vulture. Most of the effect stuff was written by me. 

Enjoy this historical artifact :)
